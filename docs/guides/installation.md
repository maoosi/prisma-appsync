# Installation

- 👉 [Sample Lambda function](#👉-bonus-sample-lambda-function)


::: danger

Prisma-AppSync is highly experimental and it is not recommended to use in Production at this stage. Breaking changes might be introduced at anytime between beta versions. Feedback, suggestions and PRs welcomed.
:::

> **Before starting, it is assumed that you have:**
> 
> - A project already setup with Prisma. If not, refer to the [Prisma Quickstart](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma) guide.
> - A database already created and ready to use with your Prisma project. [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/f1d537044c2b) generally offers good options for managed databases.

## Adding Prisma-Appsync into an existing project

### 👉 1. Add `prisma-appsync` as dev dependency

```bash
# with yarn
yarn add prisma-appsync -D

# with npm
npm install prisma-appsync -D
```

### 👉 2. Add the generator in your `schema.prisma` file

```typescript
generator appsync {
    provider = "prisma-appsync"
}
```

### 👉 3. Setup binary targets in your `schema.prisma` file

Adding the binaryTargets will ensure Prisma Engine compatibility with Lambda. For more info, please refer to the [Prisma docs for AWS Lambda](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/deployment/deploying-to-aws-lambda#binary-targets-in-schemaprisma).

```typescript{3}
generator client {
    provider = "prisma-client-js"
    binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-1.0.x"]
}
```

### 👉 4. Run `npx prisma generate` as you'd normally do

Prisma-AppSync will generate the below:

```shell
.
+-- generated
|   +-- prisma-appsync
|   |   +-- client/ # API client Class
|   |   +-- docs/ # API Docs
|   |   +-- resolvers.yaml # AppSync Resolvers
|   |   +-- schema.gql # AppSync GQL Schema
```

## Using Prisma-AppSync boilerplate

> **If you are already familiar with Amazon AWS and AppSync, you can stop here and directly use the generated files with your own setup 🚀:**
>
> - `resolver.yaml` contain all resolver mapping templates for AppSync.
> - `schema.gql` contain the GraphQL schema for AppSync.
> - `client/` contain Prisma-AppSync client, to be used within your Lambda resolver function ([see example](#👉-bonus-sample-lambda-function)).

Optionally, you can follow steps 5 & 6 to use our Boilerplate and help you get started with Prisma-AppSync AWS integration.

### 👉 5. Copy the boilerplate into your project

Executed from your project root, the following command will copy both an `handler.ts` file and a `cdk` folder into your current directory:

```shell
cp -r node_modules/prisma-appsync/boilerplate/ .
```

**The `handler.ts` file is a sample Lambda function handler:**

- To be used as principal datasource + resolver for your AWS AppSync API.
- It will contain your core business logic.

**The `cdk/` directory contains a sample AWS CDK template to:**

- Prepare and bundle the Lambda function handler.
- Setup AppSync using the files generated by Prisma-AppSync.
- Deploy the API on a specified Amazon AWS account.

### 👉 6. Deploy the GraphQL API

#### Pre-requirements

Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and configure your local environment to use your AWS account: [See guide here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/cli.html#cli-environment) (`aws configure`). Also install the [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) on your machine (`yarn global add aws-cdk` or `npm i -g aws-cdk`).

#### Deploy using AWS CDK

```shell
# go into the cdk directory
cd cdk

# install dependencies
yarn install

# edit the cdk config to your needs
# (mainly `PRISMA_CONNECTION_URL`)
code .env

# deploy into your AWS Account
cdk deploy
```

**🚀🚀🚀 Done! Your GraphQL API is now ready to use.**

## 👉 Bonus: Sample Lambda function

If you are new to Amazon AWS and AppSync, it is recommended to use the Boilerplate provided instead (steps 5 & 6).

```typescript
// import PrismaAppSync client
import { PrismaAppSync } from './prisma/generated/prisma-appsync/client'

// initialise client
const app = new PrismaAppSync({
    connectionUrl: process.env.CONNECTION_URL,
    debug: true
})

// Lambda function handler
export const main = async (event: any, context: any) => {

    // parse the `event` from your Lambda function
    app.parseEvent(event)

    // handle CRUD operations / resolve query
    const result = await app.resolve()

    // close database connection
    await app.$disconnect()

    // return query result
    return Promise.resolve(result)

})
```
